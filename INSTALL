You need to have netsnmp development library installed on your system,
For instance, on debian the package is libsnmp-dev

Basic installation guidelines

  cd to the root of the tar.gz

  ./configure
  make

The 3 binary files should be now in the src/ directory


->If you experiment some problems, try to rebuild the ./configure , make:
  
  make clean
  automake --add-missing
  autoconf

and retry the ./configure, make process

Please report any compilation issues at : vincent@xenbox.fr
